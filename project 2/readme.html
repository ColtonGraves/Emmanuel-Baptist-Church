Let’s get to it.

     I’ve attended the church for as long as I can remember. It’s the church my parents grew up in and the church i’ve grown up in. My father is a big part of the church and asked me to build him a website for it. After procrastinating immensely, this project for The CO rolled around and i realized it would be a perfect opportunity.

     I intentionally chose my color scheme based off the interior of the church. Most of the sanctuary, hymnals, and quite a few other aspects are the red accent color I used. I wanted to incorporate this color in to tie the website to the brick and mortar location. 

     Other than the color request, i’ve pretty much built the bulk of the website myself. My teacher has given me helpful suggestions along the way to help improve the website, but all the information gathered and planned structures has been predominately done by myself.

I thank you for your consideration in this contest.
